# Forced Growth

A datapack for Minecraft 1.16.x to re-enable Forced Growth

Running this datapack in 1.16.0 or 1.16.1 may give you an error or mark as incompatible. It still works, mojang was just late with updating the [datapack format number](./pack.mcmeta#L3). If you want, you can change this number to 5 to get rid of all errors.

## Installation

To install the datapack, you need to make sure you are either playing in singleplayer or have file access to the server you want to install it to. Additionally, the datapack is only supported on Vanilla and Fabric.

1. Head to https://github.com/Zefyro/Forced-Growth/releases and select the version you are using.
2. Download the `.zip` file and put it in your `datapacks` folder.
3. Run `/reload` in-game and enable the datapack.

## Incompatibilities

This datapack is unsupported on Forge and related projects.

This datapack is unsupported on all Bukkit-derivatives. Additionally, the installation procedure needs to be altered to work with Bukkit-derivatives.

This datapack is incompatible with EssentialsX and similar plugins.

## Features

This datapack aims to bring back forced growth which were removed in [snapshot 20w12a](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-20w12a) [[MC-113809]](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-113809).

Everything is toggleable so you can change it to suit your needs.
